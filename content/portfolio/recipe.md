#### HOW TO PLAY ON THAT WEBSITE?

**1. Does the word "play" annoy you**		 when it comes to work and money and politics? If you answer is yes, then why so?

> *"Do not escape! Or do it consciously..."* - just another guru

**2. Check up what your deeper personal interest is** when it comes to joining "Mutualismers?" ? Have you paid attention to those you are interacting with today in that space : are they fully aware of your personal interest(s) right now? Do you want to play using that website as a tool right now?

> *"My personal interest is to make money for "my" 5-individual collective here in Bordeaux, France. By experimenting a new way of producing contents between people who are distant to each others, I hope to use that experiment as a showcase to sell services with a minimum income/effort rate in some future"* - Habib Belaribi ([Les Ethers Fertiles](https://lesethersfertiles.eu/hello/) | [Tedua](https://www.association-tedua.fr/) | [SocialMediaSquad](https://www.socialmediasquad.cc/))

**3. Rules** : there is just one rule on this website.
- **Rule 1**: any article posted by a *Mutualismer* who knows Dil on this website, has to be an article about some other *Mutualismer* creation or content, be it an essay, a drawing, a piece of software, a poem, etc. You can post your own creations or contents on [that dedicated cloud file storage space](https://cloud.cestlebouquet.fr/index.php/s/3CMAFtNbzwFt26K) (no subscription needed, free license software) and notify the other Mutualismers on the dedicated Telegram group, as a straightforward invitation to read your contents and let them decide if they wish to post them in the form they'd fancy (or not post them at all).  
- **Rule 2**: you are freer than you think you are.  

**4. Any question**, please feel free to contact Dil Green and I at once by email or by mentioning us on the Telegram group ([details  here](http://localhost:1313/contact/)
